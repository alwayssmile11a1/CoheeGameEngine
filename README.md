# CoheeGameEngine

A 2D Game Engine With Visual Editor

This project is a redesigning version of [Duality Game Engine](https://github.com/AdamsLair/duality) using WPF instead of Winform.

# Building From Source
If you want to build this game engine yourself, you can do so using Visual Studio by simply opening CoheeGameEngine.sln and selecting "Build/Build Solution". All framework build results will be located in the shared Build/Output folder.
